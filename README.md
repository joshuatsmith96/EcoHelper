# Version 1 - 12/2/2021

# What is EcoHelper
# EcoHelper is a tool created for a game called "Eco". It is a work in progress, but the ultimate goal is for this to be a one-stop shop for guides, crafting recipes, and tips.


# How it was built

# - EcoHelper was built using the React framework, and a variety of object arrays that correspond to specific indexes.
# - Current version is incomplete, but just a proof of concept. The functionality is there, the styling is not quite there.
